Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player  always moves first, and both players always play optimally.The rules of the game are as follows:

Initially there are  towers.
Each tower is of height .
The players move in alternating turns.
In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height  and reduce its height to , where  and  evenly divides .
If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
Given the values of  and , determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return . Otherwise, return .

Example. 

There are  towers, each  units tall. Player  has a choice of two moves:
- remove  pieces from a tower to leave  as 
- remove  pieces to leave 

Let Player  remove . Now the towers are  and  units tall.

Player  matches the move. Now the towers are both  units tall.

Now Player  has only one move.

Player  removes  pieces leaving . Towers are  and  units tall.
Player  matches again. Towers are both  unit tall.

Player  has no move and loses. Return .

Explanation

We'll refer to player  as  and player  as 

In the first test case,  chooses one of the two towers and reduces it to . Then  reduces the remaining tower to a height of . As both towers now have height ,  cannot make a move so  is the winner.

In the second test case, there is only one tower of height .  can reduce it to a height of either  or .  chooses  as both players always choo
